# Sprinkle

Sprinkle is a directory of local restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars, shops, and
services curated and maintained by employees/students of Makers Academy (or
whatever organization you belong to). The purpose is to help new hires and
students easily find places to dine and socialize.

Sprinkle is named after nothing in particular. We just like a sprinkle of jQuery
now and again.

To run:

```
git clone git@github.com:deniseyu/sprinkle.git
cd sprinkle
padrino s
```
